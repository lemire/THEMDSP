Usage for ConsoleExtractor.exe
April 19th, 2001
Daniel Lemire, Ph.D.

Warning: this tool is not meant for day to day use. It is a purposely
simple console application to extract and process data from THEM Dat
files. Normally, a GUI tool should wrap the underlying DSP library
and provide acquisition and realtime processing. PLEASE DO NOT COMPLAIN
THAT IT IS UNFRIENDLY, IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

Warning: THEM Dat file format isn't defined nor supported by anyone.
The provided support for the THEM Dat is not likely to be perfect but
it was tested with available Dat files.


General usage:
ConsoleExtractor.exe inputdatfile EMi outputbinfile firsthalfcycle lasthalfcycle baselinecorrection downsampling despikecoef tau outputtextfile integrate

where

inputdatfile	: name of you Dat file (full path)
EMi 		: EM1, EM2, EM3 or EM4 (the channel you want to extract)
outputbinfile 	: name of output binary file containing the data you extracted and processed
firsthalfcycle	: first half-cycle to process
lasthalfcycle	: last half-cycle to process
baselinecorrection : whether to correct the baseline 1=true, 0=false
downsampling	: downsampling (stacking) factor, 0 disables stacking, 6 is a usual value
despikecoef	: despike coefficient (example 100)
tau		: whether to apply tau projection 1=true, 0=false
outputtextfile	: output text file where to put the first 50 half-cycles
integrate	: whether to integrate offtime data 1=true, 0=false (require tau projection)

Examples: 
	ConsoleExtractor.exe d:\bob3.dat EM2 test.bin 1 3001 1 1 100 0 rraw.txt
	ConsoleExtractor.exe d:\bob3.dat EM2 test.bin 1 3001 1 6 100 1 rraw.txt
	ConsoleExtractor.exe d:\bob3.dat EM2 test.bin 1 3001

Limitations: 

*) integration of offtime values is only possible if tau projection is activated
*) only one channel can be extracted at a time
*) extracting very large amount of data will require a long time if tau projection is activated
	(memory usage should always be small)
