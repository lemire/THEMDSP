THEMDSP : Digital Signal Processing Library for Geophysics
=====================================================================



It is a prototypical C++ library for digital signal processing
in the context of airborne electromagnetic exploration. 

Current state
--------------


The software is unmaintained and undocumentated. Some components
of this work went into production, but most of it was just for
demonstration and research purposes. It was written for Windows 
machines between 1999 and 2001. There was no unit testing of any
kind: expect the code to be flat out wrong at times.

Usage 
------

There is no project file or makefile. It is likely that this code
will not build without some effort. It is not mean to be usable
as-is.


Why are you releasing it?
-------------------------

Some of the ideas developed with this code did end up being
tremendously useful in practice.
